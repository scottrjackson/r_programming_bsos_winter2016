Find three relationships in your data.  For each relationship, do the following:

1. Verbally articulate the relationship you want to examine.

2. Verbally identify what variables you want to map to each graphical dimension.

3. Reshape your data as needed.

4. Use ggplot2 to create your graph.

5. Fiddle with colors, axis labels, themes, etc. until the plot looks "publication ready" to you.  Try to change at least one thing per plot.

6. Save all plots to a format that you could use in a paper.  HINT: PNG works well for pasting into Word documents.
