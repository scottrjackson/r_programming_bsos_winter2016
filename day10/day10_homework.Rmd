Thanks for a great class!  I appreciate everyone's participation, willingness to ask questions, and willingness to share when things were going wrong.  I'd love to keep doing this class, and hopefully improve on it.  Here are a few questions that I have about how things went.  If you have other feedback, I'd love to hear that, too.

THIS HOMEWORK IS DUE NEXT SUNDAY, JANUARY 24.  I will be getting all of your homework and project comments back to you by then, so please take those into account when thinking about the course.

1. What do you feel was the most useful topic covered in the class?

2. What was the most difficult/confusing topic in the class?

3. What topics were not covered (or were not covered sufficiently), that you would have liked to have seen?

4. Do you feel like the homework (including review and feedback) was an important part of your learning?

5. Are there things about the homework that you would have liked changed, in order to be more helpful?

6. How useful/distracting was the use of git and GitHub in the class?

7. How useful/distracting was the use of R Markdown in the class?

8. Any other thoughts/comments?

Thanks!
